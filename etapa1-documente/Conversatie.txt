ok, i'd say to think it as a produc
product*
not a custom forum for a company
but something to be used by any company
for internal development
Anca Barbu
10/18, 9:54pm
Anca Barbu
yes, i agree. so  an account will be created for each company
Constantin Costescu
10/18, 9:54pm
Constantin Costescu
i liked the idea that someone can post public, or group (in this case group meaning visible just inside the company)
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 9:56pm
Alexandru Costin
Reddit and Slack are the inspirations
Anca Barbu
10/18, 9:56pm
Anca Barbu
this should be a plus. but we should base on the ideea of an intern forum with internal visibility of posts
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 9:57pm
Marian Spoiala
there are two possibilities
a product that will be deployed on a server and every company/small firm will create an account
and add it's employees
Anca Barbu
10/18, 9:58pm
Anca Barbu
its departments
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 9:58pm
Marian Spoiala
or a product that can be fastly deployed and used by any company/start up
to start sharing ideas
and solve issues
and there are also risks
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 9:59pm
Alexandru Costin
Might be a good idea to be able to share files/pictures
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 9:59pm
Marian Spoiala
if it's deployed only once and the company's will start sharing ideas on a common server
there will be severe security issues
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:00pm
Anca Barbu
and we could have non-company users which create accounts just for fun grin emoticon but in this scenario we can implement that part with public posting
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:00pm
Marian Spoiala
on the other hand, if the firms will deploy the application on a local server, than it can only be accesed locally or through a vpn
=> the mobile part of the app won't be that useful
my internet is slow
and i didn't receive any of your messages until now
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:02pm
Anca Barbu
since 2 of us are willing to work on mobile part and since the first scenario enables us to implement that  nice public posting stuff
and since this is just a demo app and we won't have to troubleshoot security issues
i'd rather go for the case in which the app will be only once deployed
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:03pm
Marian Spoiala
i agree with you
so we are going to be needing a server to deploy the app
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:04pm
Alexandru Costin
Any ideas?
Parse.com won't be good for this project
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:04pm
Marian Spoiala
a server which supports java and a database
let me see if we can use it
anyway
at the beggining
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:05pm
Anca Barbu
i don't have experience with deploying apps, but i'm sure that we will find a solution on this issue. we should start talking about technologies
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:05pm
Marian Spoiala
we can deploy locally
on our computer
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:05pm
Anca Barbu
yes, ofc grin emoticon
for the web version we will develop the frontend with html, css, bootstrap and angular js
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:07pm
Marian Spoiala
and for the backend since we are familiar with java
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:07pm
Anca Barbu
we will make request qo some RESTs which  will be exposed from serverside(Java)
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:07pm
Marian Spoiala
ook
java backend with spring framework?
or jax?
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:07pm
Anca Barbu
yep, spring mvc and spring data jpa
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:07pm
Marian Spoiala
that sounds ok to me
for learning there are some goog tutorials
from pluralsight
and i think those are available on youtube
step by step tutorials on how to create a web app
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:09pm
Alexandru Costin
On the mobile side, we will develop and Android app
an*
It will probably run on the latest version (5.1.1)
To fully benefit from all the new API
Google added in recent versions
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:10pm
Marian Spoiala
5.1.1 is the android version?
what about backward compatibility? because most users don't have the latest android
Constantin Costescu
10/18, 10:10pm
Constantin Costescu
i don't have the latest Android on my phone
i have 5.0.2
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:10pm
Marian Spoiala
i think the app should work starting from 4.2
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:11pm
Alexandru Costin
My phone has it, but we can start with an older version
Constantin Costescu
10/18, 10:11pm
Constantin Costescu
most user don't have the latst version because when you buy from HTC/Samsung, etc
each company adds it's own features
and it takes awhile before the company releases the latest version
anyway, we should make it compatible with 4+, considering the many people have older phones and have yet to install latest versions (if the phone even supports them)
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:13pm
Marian Spoiala
ok and for the pc version
we can use angular
it is compatible with chrome/mozilla/IE 9+
angular 1.x !!
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:14pm
Anca Barbu
yep, but we have to ensure that our REST api can be integrated with android
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:14pm
Marian Spoiala
the rest are available
for any call
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:14pm
Anca Barbu
i don't think ie supports angular
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:14pm
Marian Spoiala
it supports angular
i tested
starting from IE9 it works
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:15pm
Alexandru Costin
Minimum requirement: IE9 or greater!
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:15pm
Marian Spoiala
the rest resources are available for any ajax call
there is a small problem
cross domain call
Constantin Costescu
10/18, 10:15pm
Constantin Costescu
i rly doubt any self respecting company will use IE to access our app
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:16pm
Marian Spoiala
i don't know if the android ajax calls(and i suppose that those are ajax calls)
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:16pm
Anca Barbu
Microsoft would do :)))
Constantin Costescu
10/18, 10:16pm
Constantin Costescu
if it want IE, we don't do bussiness woth them grin emoticon
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:16pm
Marian Spoiala
are allowed from andoird to the java backend
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:17pm
Anca Barbu
i don't know that either, Marian. Costin, Alex?
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:17pm
Alexandru Costin
There are API out there that do this thing
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:17pm
Marian Spoiala
ook
so we will worry at the right time
there muse be a solution to this
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:17pm
Alexandru Costin
Only problem will be to find one for the right version
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:17pm
Marian Spoiala
so we need to expose some REST resources
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:18pm
Alexandru Costin
But it should be ok
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:18pm
Marian Spoiala
that cand be called
can*
and return the request info from the db
in json or xml format?
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:18pm
Anca Barbu
json would be ok for angular grin emoticon
but with android might not be the same
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:19pm
Marian Spoiala
i don't really know android, so we will need to do some research on this
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:19pm
Alexandru Costin
JSON is ok for Android too
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:19pm
Marian Spoiala
oh, ok then
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:19pm
Anca Barbu
yyeeay
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:19pm
Marian Spoiala
grin emoticon
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:19pm
Alexandru Costin
there's something called JSONObject for Android
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:20pm
Anca Barbu
great grin emoticon
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:20pm
Alexandru Costin
So it's all good
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:20pm
Marian Spoiala
what about security? android knows about cookies?
Constantin Costescu
10/18, 10:20pm
Constantin Costescu
it's easy to read JSON in Android
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:20pm
Marian Spoiala
or tokens?
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:20pm
Alexandru Costin
Tokens yes
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:20pm
Marian Spoiala
ok, we could use tokens
that expire
after an amount of time
after an amount of inactive time
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:21pm
Anca Barbu
speaking of databse, since we are going to use Spring Data JPA for accessing the db
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:21pm
Marian Spoiala
i recently worked in a project with postgres
and it's really easy to use
what about you?
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:22pm
Anca Barbu
awesome, i worked with mysql and seemed very easy
but heard from others that postgres is ok too
Alexandru Costin

I am working with PLSQL at the Databases laboratory. Feels great man
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:23pm
Marian Spoiala
plsql is database?
isn't it
scripting language
?
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:23pm
Alexandru Costin
Yeah, my bad, I was thinking if it;'s worth using a database + PLSQL on Android
but it might be too hard and not worth it
To save some offline data, in case you don't have internet
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:24pm
Marian Spoiala
we could save some offline data
i don't know exactly in what format
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:29pm
Alexandru Costin
Well, I think this is a great start for the backend technologies
It will change in time for sure...but we'll see then
What about the GUI?
Any ideas for the desktop part?
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:30pm
Marian Spoiala
for the pc version
we could use bootstrap
that comes with a lot of cool stuff
that looks good
and we can personalize the colors and dimensions
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:31pm
Alexandru Costin
There's bootstrap for Android too
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:32pm
Anca Barbu
yep, bootstrap indeed. we can also look for a predefined theme on the internet and adapt it to our preferences
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:32pm
Marian Spoiala
yup
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:34pm
Alexandru Costin
Are there any online designers for bootstrap?
To have a preview of our GUI
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:35pm
Anca Barbu
by online designers you mean a tool in which we can simulate how our app is going to look?
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:36pm
Alexandru Costin
Yes, an app in which you can simply buttons and other controls in a canvas
And see how it looks
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:36pm
Anca Barbu
axure
there is an extension for chrome availabe
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:37pm
Alexandru Costin
Checked it now and looks great
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:38pm
Marian Spoiala
we should start by creating a git account
so we could work together
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:40pm
Anca Barbu
i have one already
Constantin Costescu
10/18, 10:40pm
Constantin Costescu
me 2
i guess eveyone has at least one git account
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:40pm
Alexandru Costin
I also have one
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:41pm
Marian Spoiala
how should we name
our project/app?
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 10:41pm
Alexandru Costin
Will the account be public?
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:41pm
Marian Spoiala
the project no
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:41pm
Anca Barbu
i'd suggest to make a private repi
*repo
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:41pm
Marian Spoiala
yup
Constantin Costescu
10/18, 10:41pm
Constantin Costescu
the project repo should be private
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:42pm
Anca Barbu
i can make one, i have 5 free private repos
grin emoticon
for 2 years
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:42pm

nice
ok
Anca Barbu
10/18, 10:42pm

How about Qorum
from quorum
I think it describes the purpose of this project
Somehow
Constantin Costescu
10/18, 10:48pm
Constantin Costescu
A quorum is the minimum number of members of a deliberative assembly necessary to conduct the business of that group.
if we use qorum, the marketing wil be easy smile emoticon

quorum sounds fine
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 10:52pm
Marian Spoiala
i vote for qorum too
Marian Spoiala
so qorum it is
anca, will you create the repo?

super
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 11:19pm
Alexandru Costin
i think we are on right path
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 11:23pm
Marian Spoiala
i think we should establish what each of us are going to do in this project. i mean on what each of us should focus more
since i have some background experience on java backend and javascript/angular frontend, i would right to study more about these technologies
but i am also interested in android
i don't want android to be something i neglect in this project
but i'd like to focus more on the backend and security
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 11:27pm
Alexandru Costin
I have little to no experience in Angular
I feel more comfortable in Android
And a bit in Bootstrap
Constantin Costescu
10/18, 11:29pm
Constantin Costescu
I'm very interested in mobile  technoligies and i have some experience in Android. I would like to use this project to further increase my familiarity with Android SDK
Anca Barbu
10/18, 11:33pm
Anca Barbu
I'm more interested in using Java related technologis. I would like to worik mostly on the db part and the backend part, but also on frontend with angular
i admit that i'm not so into web design :))
but i can hel on that too
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 11:34pm
Alexandru Costin
Well the good news is that this project will mostly use Java
Android uses Java too
So it's a big plus
If any of us wants to learn more about one platform, it should be easier because of this
Anca Barbu
10/18, 11:38pm
Anca Barbu
i agree and  i am willing to learn a bit of android too,  since on the second semester i will have a course based on it, Maybe i won't help in developing the android part but i would like to take a look from time to time at the android module of this project
and understand things grin emoticon
Alexandru Costin
10/18, 11:42pm
Alexandru Costin
Alright then
I think we can wrap it up?
Anca Barbu
10/18, 11:45pm

in my oppinion, yes.
Marian Spoiala
10/18, 11:48pm
